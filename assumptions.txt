as storage accounts are encrypted by default, I assume as you directly mentioned it, that you would like to use non default key (which assumption was then aborted)
scripts will be extended, so module with all the usual crap is created (even if now it's overkill), so it will be easier in future
loging is done via write-host and not anything more useful
testing will be done manually, so credential can be passed as a parameter - not the best approach, but good for this purpose
pester test for more sophisticated stuff, are outside of scope of this task (so they are partially removed or not created)
did pass any parameters to the parameters file as the default ones are sufficient
